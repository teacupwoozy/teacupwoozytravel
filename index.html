					travel planning services for digital nomads.</p>

			<header><h2>WHY WE TRAVEL</h2></header>
			<div class="background-ocean-box">
				<br><br>
				<p>For my clients, travel is about more than just ticking off items on a destination bucket list. 
				Travel can be about reconnecting with yourself and the people you love. It can be about making 
				connections with total strangers in ways that transcend language and borders. And, travel can be 
				a totally immersive experience that stays with you for years afterward.</p>
				<p>I love designing these personalized travel experiences for my clients and keeping them far, far 
					away from overcrowded and uninspiring cookie-cutter vacations. Instead, I want my clients to 
					be able to experience the things that are interesting and meaningful to them.</p>
				<p>I take care of the planning details and make sure you have a wonderful selection of the types of 
					accommodations, flights, and experiences you have your heart set on. But, more importantly, I 
					also make sure that the trip I plan for you has the right vibe that you're going for and sets 
					you on your way to having incredible experiences.</p>
				<p>In other words, if you're looking for something more than a selfie in front of the Mona Lisa, 
					then I'm the one for you. Click the button below to get started and learn more about my travel 
					planning service.</p>
