			<br>
			<p>Stacy Montemayor is the Owner and Operator of Teacup Woozy LLC (“we,” “us,” “I,” and “our”) and 
				.com (the “Site,” “website”) and, as an internet-based business, respects and recognizes the 
				importance of your privacy rights. This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for the 
				Site. The terms “user,” “you,” and “your” refer to Site visitors, customers, and any other users 
				 the Site. The term "Services" refers to products and services offered by Teacup Woozy, including 
				 but not limited to a blog, email newsletters, books, ebooks, travel planning consulting packages, 
				 courses, and programs offered through this Site.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Please read this statement carefully and if you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please 
				discontinue your use of this Site. Your continued use of the Site indicates your acceptance of 
				this policy. This policy may be changed at any time, at the owner’s discretion. If we should 
				 this policy, we will post the updates to this page and email our subscribers in order to notify 
				 them of the changes.</p>
			<br>
			<h5>Information collection</h5>
			<p>When you visit the website, we will learn some information about you from your visit.</p>
			<br>
			<h5>Information we collect that you provide</h5>
			<p>There are various places on the website where you may fill out and submit information. For example, 
				if you sign up for my newsletter, we will ask you for personal information like your name and email 
				address. Or, if you fill out a form to receive my products or services, we will collect your name, 
				email address and your answers you provide. We collect that information via forms, surveys, and 
				comments. When you provide this information to us, we use it to deliver the requested products, 
				services, information, and promotions. We also use this information to improve your experience on 
				the website and our products and services.</p>
			<br>
			<h5>Information we collect via automatic data collection technology</h5>
			<p>When you visit this website, we may use automatic data collection technology like Google Analytics 
				to collect information about the equipment you're using and your browsing behaviors. Examples of 
				the type of information we collect are: what type of device you are browsing on (including device 
				type, service provider, and operating system), location information (based on your IP address), 
				and your behavior on the website (what pages are visited and for how long).</p>
			<br>
			<h5>What we do with this information</h5>
			<p>We are committed protecting your personal data. The information that you provide to us (i.e.: via 
				forms, the newsletter signup, comments, etc.) is used to provide services and information to you 
				that you have requested. The data that we collect from you via automatic data collection (i.e.: 
				Google Analytics) is used to provide better products and services and a better browsing experience 
				for all users.</p>
			<br>
			<h5>Disclosure of your personal data</h5>
			<p>As a general rule, we are not in the habit of selling, renting, giving, or transferring your personal 
				data. If we sell, merge, or transfer all or part of Teacup Woozy to another party or parties, we 
				will require that the party(ies) respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in 
				accordance with the law.</p>
			<br>
			<p>As part of providing services and products to you, we may disclose your personal data to service 
				providers who provide technology support and professional advisors (accountants, lawyers, etc.) 
				we contract with.</p>
			<br>
			<h5>How we protect your personal data</h5>
			<p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit information via the website, your 
				information is protected both online and offline. We have in place security measures that are designed 
				to prevent your personal data from being accidentally used, lost, or stolen. We also limit access 
				to your personal data to employees, contractors, and third parties who have a need to know this 
				information.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The entire website is encrypted and information that is transmitted is done so in a secure way. This 
				means that wherever we collect sensitive information (personal information, etc.), that information 
				is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon 
				in the address bar of your browser and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the 
				webpage. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect 
				your information offline. The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable 
				information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
			<br>
			<h5>Data storage and retention</h5>
			<br>
			<p>We only keep your personal data for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it 
				was collected. Additionally, we may retain your personal data for accounting or reporting purposes 
				(i.e.: seven years for U.S. Tax audit purposes).</p>
			<br>
			<h5>Cookies</h5>
			<br>
			<p>The site also makes use of cookies, which are small files that your web browser places on your hard 
				drive for record-keeping purposes. Like most other websites, we use cookies to improve and make your 
				browsing experience more enjoyable and personalized (i.e.: language settings). Cookies enable us to 
				provide a better experience for our users. The use of cookies also enables us to collect non-identifiable 
				demographic information. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. However, most browsers automatically
				 accept cookies, but you should be able to modify your browser's settings to decline cookies. This may
				  prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>
			<br>
			<h5>Links</h5>
			<p>Please note that the Site may contain links to other third party websites that are not operated by us. 
				This policy does not apply to such third party websites and we are not responsible for the content on 
				those websites or their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the terms of use and privacy 
				policies of every website you visit.</p>
			<br>
			<h5>Your rights</h5>
			<p>You have a right to access the data we have stored about you. You have a right to have your data 
				corrected or deleted. You have a right to the portability of your data. You have a right to withdraw 
				consent at any time. You have a right to complain to your national Data Protection Agency. If you do 
				have a complaint, we would ask you to contact us first so that we may try and remedy the situation 
				for you. In most cases, we will respond within one month of your request for this information or change 
				of information. If you wish to make a request, you may contact us at stacy@teacupwoozy.com or Teacup Woozy 
				LLC, 30 N Gould St, Suite 7001, Sheridan, WY 82801.</p>
