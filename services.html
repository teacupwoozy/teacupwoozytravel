			<h4>I will sort through dozens, if not hundreds, of accommodations and curate a small selection that I believe will really suit you and the trip you have in mind.</h4>
			<p>Sorting through dozens, if not hundreds, of accommodations listings and reviews can be an incredibly time-consuming task. And, quite frankly, it can be overwhelming for a lot of people.</p>
			<p>And, when you aren't familiar with the destination, it's easy to inadvertently pick the wrong place to stay. Over the years, I’ve heard countless stories from disappointed travelers who, despite their best efforts, still ended up staying at the wrong place: outer edges of the city that required they travel an hour on the metro each way, sterile hotels with no charm of the city they’re staying in, an Airbnb that was nothing like what the photos showed. Unfortunately, the list goes on and on.</p>
			<p>The perfect places to stay are out there, and I can find them for you.</p>
			<p>Based on your answers to the questionnaire below, I will identify three or five accommodations that will fit with what you're looking for in your vacation. Then, all you’ll have to do is pick the one you like best and book it. Using my services will save you hours and hours of laborious searching, as well as the heartache of picking the wrong place.</p>
			<h5>PRICES START AT $60</h5>

			<h5>WHAT'S INCLUDED</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>A carefully curated list of three or five accommodations, based on your wants and needs.</li>
				<li>Contact information, pricing, features, and amenities for each accommodation.</li>
				<li>Details about the surrounding areas. </li>
				<li>Any pertinent pros or cons for the accommodation - I strive for total transparency so that you can make informed decisions about where you'll stay. So, if an accommodation is perfect in every way, but all of the reviews mention roosters crowing at the crack of dawn, I'm going to tell you!</li>
				<li>And, sometimes, I throw in an extra Wildcard accommodation at no additional cost to you. These accommodations are options that don't fit the specs provided by the client, but there is something special about them that could be a good fit for the client.</li>
				<li>All of your trip information is provided in a convenient electronic format.</li>
